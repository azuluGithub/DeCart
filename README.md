<h2> De Cart Project Description: </h2>

 ```diff
 + This project is about creating APIâ€™s, API Authentication and verification when getting data
 + An API key system is used to generate API keys and these keys are used to perform cart system actions such as: Create cart, Get Cart, Update Cart and Delete Cart [CRUD operations]
 + The key is verified and validated on every request
 + A simple Full-Stack [MERN] is implemented
 +  => Mongodb is used as data storage
 +  => Express and Node as a server for API, API authentication and verification
 +  => React Front-End is used for client authentication, Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting cart
